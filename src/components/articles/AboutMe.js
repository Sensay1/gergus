        <p>
            I am an especially curious person with a variety of interests. I have built drones, bult a campervan, been a climbing instructor, lived in a van, learnt how to weld, been a mechanic, studied material sciences, now working as an IT consultant, but most importantly I build software.
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan to work full time as a developer, and I am currently studying informatics at NTNU. Right now, I am looking for an inspiring and educational summer job for the summer of 2022. I currently have part time work at Experis out the semester.
